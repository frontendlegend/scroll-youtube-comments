##### Google Chrome Extension 
## Scroll YouTube comments and watch video simultaneously!

I use it when I watch live shows and jump on timecodes, or when I'm just curious what others think and don't want to take my eyes off the video.

Initially made for personal use, but recently I thought that someone can find it pretty handy too, please enjoy!
